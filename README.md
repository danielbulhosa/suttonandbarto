# Reinforcement Learning, 2nd Edition Coding Exercises

This repo contains notebooks with the coding exercises from Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning, 2nd Edition.
The exercises covered in each notebook are listed in the title of the notebook. To the best of our knowlede the solutions
are correct, as they match what was expected from the book. Some of the notebooks are still in progress.

Binaries of outputs from certain exercises are stored in the repo for reference, so our results can be compared against
other runs or against others'.
